# Maintainers

This file lists the current maintainers of the DNS-AID project. The project continues to recruit additional maintainers — see "Desired Roles" below — to broaden organizational diversity ahead of LF graduation.

## Current Maintainers

| Name | GitHub | Affiliation | Role | Since |
|------|--------|-------------|------|-------|
| Igor Racic | [@iracic82](https://github.com/iracic82) | Infoblox | Project Lead | 2024-12 |
| Ingmar Van Glabbeek | [@ivanglabbeek](https://github.com/ivanglabbeek) | Infoblox | DNS Standards & Policy Layer Maintainer | 2026-04 |
| Nick Williams | [@NWillAU900](https://github.com/NWillAU900) | Infoblox | DNS Standards Lead | 2026-05 |

## Desired Roles

The project is looking for maintainers in the following areas:

| Role | Responsibilities | Status |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| DNS Standards Lead | IETF draft alignment, RFC compliance review | **Filled** |
| Security Lead | DNSSEC/DANE validation, vulnerability triage | **Open** |
| Backend Maintainer | DNS provider backends (Route53, Cloudflare, Infoblox, DDNS) | **Open** |
| CI/Release Engineer | GitHub Actions, release automation, SBOM generation | **Open** |
| Documentation Lead | User guides, API docs, architecture documentation | **Open** |

## How to Become a Maintainer

See [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) for the process. In brief:

1. Contribute sustained, high-quality PRs over at least 3 months
2. Be nominated by an existing maintainer
3. Receive approval via Committer vote

## Sustainability and Bus Factor

DNS-AID currently has **three maintainers**, all Infoblox-affiliated (bus factor = 3 in headcount, 1 in organizational diversity). The remaining sustainability gap — single-organization maintainership — is acknowledged transparently and is the reason `MAINTAINERS.md` lists the open roles above.

**Active mitigations**

- **Public open standard** — DNS-AID is a reference implementation of an IETF draft (`draft-mozleywilliams-dnsop-dnsaid`). The protocol is independent of any single implementation, so the standard remains viable even if this implementation pauses.
- **Conservative architecture** — the codebase deliberately favors stdlib, well-known third-party libraries (`dnspython`, `httpx`), and standard DNS records (RFC 9460 SVCB, RFC 4033-4035 DNSSEC, RFC 6698 DANE) over bespoke abstractions. New maintainers should be productive in days, not months.
- **Comprehensive automation** — CI runs lint, type-check, unit tests across Python 3.11/3.12/3.13, mock integration tests, CodeQL SAST, Bandit, OpenSSF Scorecard, dependency audit, SBOM generation, and Sigstore-signed releases on every PR. New contributors get fast, machine-checked feedback.
- **DCO + SPDX** enforced on every commit — keeps provenance unambiguous as the contributor base grows.
- **Backed by Infoblox** — the project is hosted under the [`infobloxopen`](https://github.com/infobloxopen) organization. Infoblox provides the DNS expertise that motivated DNS-AID and has committed engineering time to its development.

**Goals before LF graduation**

- An additional maintainer from a second organization (top priority)
- Documented succession process for the project lead role
- External (non-Infoblox) committer with merge rights on at least one subsystem

If you are interested in contributing in a maintainer capacity, please open a discussion at [dns-aid-core/discussions](https://github.com/infobloxopen/dns-aid-core/discussions) or contact the project lead directly.

## Release process and namespace ownership

For full transparency:

- **PyPI publishing** — the `dns-aid` package on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/dns-aid/) is published exclusively via [PyPI Trusted Publisher OIDC](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/) tied to this repository's `.github/workflows/release.yml`. No long-lived API tokens exist. Only commits that land on a `v*` tag in this repo can publish to PyPI.
- **Release artifacts** — every wheel and sdist is signed with [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) cosign keyless OIDC during the release workflow. SBOM (`sbom.json`) is generated via `cyclonedx-py` and signed alongside the artifacts.
- **GitHub branch protection** — `main` requires 1 approving review and successful status checks. With three maintainers now in place, PRs are expected to be reviewed by the non-author maintainer; admin-merge remains available as a documented fallback for time-sensitive operational changes.
